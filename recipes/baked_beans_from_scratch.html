  <h3>Directions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Step 1 
    </li>
      <p>
      Gather the ingredients
      </p>
      <img src="../images/baked_beans_from_scratch_02.webp" />
    <li>
      Step 2 
    </li>
      <p>
      Place beans in a large saucepan with 4 cups of water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 1 hour.
      </p>
      <img src="../images/baked_beans_from_scratch_03.webp" />
    <li>
      Step 3 
    </li>
      <p>
      Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Stir ketchup, maple syrup, brown sugar, molasses, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, and chili powder together in a small bowl; set aside.
      </p>

    <li>
      Step 4 
    </li>
      <p>
      Once beans have simmered for 1 hour, drain, and reserve cooking liquid. Pour beans into a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish; stir in chopped onion and molasses mixture. Stir in enough reserved cooking liquid so sauce covers beans by 1/4 inch.
      </p>
      <img src="../images/baked_beans_from_scratch_05.webp" />
    <li>
      Step 5 
    </li>
      <p>
      Cover and bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes; reduce heat to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C) and cook 6 hours longer, stirring beans after they have cooked for 3 hours. Once beans are tender and sauce has reduced and is sticky, remove from the oven, stir, recover, and allow to stand 15 minutes before serving.
